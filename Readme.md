This project consists of 1 main executable file "main.py" and 4 different modules. Each of the modules contains decorators used in "main.py". The project is the part of the Assignment 1 for Software Design with Python course.

*Requires Python version 3.3 or newer.


To run the project, run the "main.py". Optionally, you can pass a filename as an argument to the call to redirect the output to the specified file.

The "main.py" should test decorators from all 4 modules. The results from the "main.py" will be printed to the stdout, or the specified file. Test results of each task will begin with the following string: "---   Testing Task #:   ---". The results from the "task3.py" and "task4.py" will be printed to "Task3.txt" and "Task4.txt" respectively. Error log generated by "task4.py" will be printed to "Task4_log.txt".
